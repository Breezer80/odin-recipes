   <h3>Salmon patties are a great dinner idea for the whole family to enjoy</h3>
   <p>This recipe was a staple of my childhood.  My dad would often have my siblings and
    I helping him make dinner, and salmon patties was definitely a favorite in our family. 
    Even my picky eater brother enjoyed them!</p>
    <p>The best part is they are an easy weeknight dinner.  Well, actually...the best part is that
        they taste fantastic!  The crispy outside is just perfection and I like to dip mine in honey
        or maple syrup for a sweet finish.
