   <h1>BREAD PUDDING</h1>

   <h2>A delicious dessert made from ingredients you probably already have at home.</h2>
   <p>I <strong>love</strong> this recipe because it's easy and frugal - you most likely already have the ingredients
    your pantry.  It's a great way to use up older stale bread and it tastes delicious too.  Eat it as 
    dessert or breakfast or a snack!</p>
    <p> I think it tastes the best when you use a soft bread.  Stale hot dog or hamburger buns do great
        in this recipe and the best part is there is <em>zero</em> waste.  I hope really hope you enjoy this recipe!
